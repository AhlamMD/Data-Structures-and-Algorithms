# Data Structures and Algorithms

Clean and simple implementation in Go

## Implementation

There are several data structures and algorithms implemented in this project. The list will be replenished with time.

##### Data structures

- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree

##### Searching algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search

- Cocktail Sort

## Usage

The library is not intended for direct use by importing. We strongly recommend copying the necessary implementations and adjusting to your case.

You can download the source using `go get` command:

```
go get github.com/floyernick/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```

Don't forget about proverb:
> A little copying is better than a little dependency.
